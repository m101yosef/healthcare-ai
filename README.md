# Healthcare AI and Analytics
This will be a new series where I will choose a healthcare problem or topic and analyse it. This is not just another machine learning experiment. This is about people. It’s about using numbers to understand risk, reveal patterns, and hopefully, make a difference.

## The Why
I want to specialise in healthcare AI, and I believe the best way to learn is to work on real problems, not just tutorials. I also want to build a public body of work that reflects both skill and purpose — something that helps others while helping me grow.
